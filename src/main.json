  "about": "I love working in the sweet spot between design and code. I use cutting-edge technology to design &amp; develop usable applications and interactive experiences. I'm passionate about design &amp; development and I live to learn constantly. My focus is on frontend engineering, but I often hop the fence and work on visual design and UX or do some backend development. I have previously worked with Adobe and LinkedIn and I'm currently looking for my next new challenge! Let's work together!",

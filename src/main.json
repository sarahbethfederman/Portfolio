  "about": "Hey! I'm a 4th year creative web developer and New Media Design major at Rochester Institute of Technology. I use cutting-edge technology to design &amp; develop usable applications and interactive experiences. I'm passionate about design &amp; development and I live to learn constantly. My focus is on frontend engineering, but I often hop the fence and work on visual design and UX or do some backend development. I'm currently finishing up my BFA this fall, and then starting a full-time role as a Web Developer at LinkedIn in January. <em>Not currently accepting new clients.</em>",
